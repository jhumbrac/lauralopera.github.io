	<h1>Visual Design Elements/by Laura Lopera</h1>
	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<ul>
          <li><a href="http://agigen.se" target="_blank">Agigen Creative Web Agency</a>.</li>
          <li><a href="http://mariusz.cc/index.values.html?utm_expid=70299007-5.r95_xbLsTxughGiAj88bvQ.1" target="_blank">Mariusz Ciesla, Coding Designer</a>.</li>
        </ul>

	<h2>Why they exhibit effective use of space, size and balance?</h2>
	<p>They both have a effective use of <strong>space</strong> because there is a good proportion between the elements that are part of the focal point and hierarchy. There is a interesting flow when you are using them.</p>
	<p><strong>Sizes</strong> of objects are clear to point where the designer wants the user to focus. In both of them the focus point is very similar: a message of what they do and the background image.</p>
	<p>The sites are as well <strong>balanced</strong> as the visual arrangement is very organised and logical order.</p>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>They are VERY similar. They have alike design, graphics, arrangements and use of the space.</p>
	<p>Agigen (which is and agency) is more complex, it has more content and it is more elaborated, it has also an extended menu and some animation. Mariusz (who is a freelancer) is specific and the rest of the website is very visual.</p>

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Front Page that displays Menu and Services</strong></li><br>
		<img src="wireframe.png" alt="My Website">
	</ul>

	<p>The Sketches show how the "main image" with the "big title"  and the menu btton are the focal point. They are the first set of elements that the user see.</p>
	<p>The hierarchy starts at the menu botton and as the user goes down, the list of services listed are classified by topics.</p>
	<p>The flow is very simple because it does not have many elements and the change of colors and images guides the user to find the next topic by going blow.</P>
